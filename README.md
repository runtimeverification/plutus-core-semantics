KPlutus - K Semantics of Plutus-Core
====================================

Dependencies
------------

-   Install needed K dependencies: <https://github.com/kframework/k>
-   Update submodules: `git submodule update --init --recursive`
-   Make dependencies: `make deps RELEASE=true`

Building
--------

-   Build everything: `make build -j8`
-   Build LLVM backend: `make build-llvm -j8`
-   Build just KPlutus runner and includes: `make build-kplutus -j8`

Testing
-------

-   Conformance tests: `make conformance-test`
    Runs all tests where an input program is executed by the `kplc run` command.
    The output is compared against the reference implementation.

-   Simple hand-written tests: `make test-simple`
    These contain small tests that have been written during the development of the semantics.

-   Examples generated by the uplc program: `make test-uplc-examples`
    The uplc program contains several small examples. These are slightly larger programs than files in simple tests.

-   Examples benchmark examples: `test-benchmark-validation-examples`
    This contains many examples derived from the plutus-apps directory. These represent are more realistic plutus programs.

-   Examples generated by the nofib-exe program: test-nofib-exe-examples
    nofib-exe is a program that generates large programs that can serve as performance tests.
