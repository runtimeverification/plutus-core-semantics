# How to generate a trivial native-tokens policy
1. Get IOG's `plutus` working on your system.
   - Clone Plutus commit ID: bcdd1ceffc93c733d90f5b89bcfae47d21dc2fcd.
   - Follow instructions at `https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus#how-to-build-the-projects-artifacts` 
   - Make sure `liblzma-dev` is installed in your system. 
   - Make sure file `shell.nix` has code similar to the following, if it doesn't already. The relevant issue is to have `lzma` there:
   ```shell
   # build inputs from nixpkgs ( -> ./nix/default.nix )
   nixpkgsInputs = (with pkgs; [
    # ...
    lzma
    # ...
   ] ++ (lib.optionals (!stdenv.isDarwin) [ rPackages.plotly R ]));
   ```
1. Change to `plutus` directory and run `nix-shell`. Run the following steps inside `nix-shell`.
2. Change to `plutus-semantics/native-tokens/native-tokens`.
3. Run `cabal build`.
4. Run `cabal run native-tokens-scripts out_scripts scripts`.
5. There will be 5 flat format files in `out_scripts`.
   In bash, run the following command. (Make sure 
   `.../plutus/dist-newstyle/build/x86_64-linux/ghc-8.10.4.20210212/plutus-core-0.1.0.0/x/uplc/build/uplc/uplc` is in your `PATH`.)
   ```shell
   for i in out_scripts/*.flat ; do uplc convert --if flat -i $i --of textual -o $i.uplc ; done
   ```

6. It's possible to generate "bare" UPLC code, without arguments, from
   parameterized policies. File `nft.uplc`, which has he UPLC code for
   its policy, can be generated by:
   1. Run `cabal repl`.
   2. Execute
      1. `import PlutusTx`
      2. `import UntypedPlutusCore`
      3. `import UntypedPlutusCore.Pretty`
      4. `:l src/Contracts/NFT.hs`
      5. `writeFile "nft.uplc" $ show $ prettyClassicDebug $ getPlc $ cPolicy`
          where `cPolicy` is a binding in `src/Contracts/NFT.hs` to the following snippet:
          `$$(PlutusTx.compile [|| \oref' tn' -> Scripts.wrapMintingPolicy $ mkPolicy oref' tn' ||])`

Files `native-tokens/native-tokens/CompiledPolicy*.uplc` were
generated using the procedure described on issue
[#233](https://github.com/runtimeverification/plutus-core-semantics/issue/233). File
`native-tokens/free-1-decoded-bytestrings.uplc` is the same as 
`native-tokens/out_scripts/free-1.uplc` but with the bytestring arguments (at the end of the file) manually
transalated to their textual format.
